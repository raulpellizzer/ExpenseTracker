# Notes for next steps

## We need to define what an "expense" will be made of.
### Each expense item should have:

- Name (string)
- Description (string)
- Category (string)
- Date (Datetime) - when something was purchased, for example
- Place (string) - where was this
- Amount (double) - the amount of the expense
